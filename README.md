### ⚠️ Antivirus False Positives?

Because Kurumi’s Autoclicker uses global hotkeys and automation features (mouse & keyboard simulation), some antivirus tools might **falsely detect it** as malware.

#### ✅ But it is safe:

* No data is collected or transmitted  
* The app runs only when you open it  
* You control what it does and when
