### 🔑 Key System (New in 1.0.7)

To use the app, you’ll need a **valid key**. This helps prevent abuse and unwanted reuploads.

You can get the key in two ways:

* 📌 Check the `#projects` channel on our Discord
* 🤖 DM the bot with `!key` to receive your current valid key

Once you enter it, it’s saved in `key.json` and automatically checked at startup.

### 🌐 Other Projects Page

**New in 1.0.7**: Added a dedicated page to discover other Kurumi tools:

* [Kurumi’s Minecraft](https://github.com/Kurumi-fan/Kurumi-s-minecraft)
* [Kurumi’s Crosshair](https://github.com/Kurumi-fan/Kurumi-s-Crosshair)

### 🔔 Update Checker

* Automatic update check on startup
* Simple "Update" button if a new version is available
* Downloads and replaces the `.exe` automatically

6. Save/load profiles to reuse setups

### ⚠️ Antivirus False Positives?

Because Kurumi’s Autoclicker uses global hotkeys and automation features (mouse & keyboard simulation), some antivirus tools might **falsely detect it** as malware.

#### ✅ But it is safe:

* No data is collected or transmitted
* The app runs only when you open it
* You control what it does and when

Need proof?
